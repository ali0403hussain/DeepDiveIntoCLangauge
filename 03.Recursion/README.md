# Recursion in c 
C language provides the feature of recursion. Recursion means that you can create a function that can call itself multiple times until a given condition is true, just like the loops.

Recursion in C programming provides the functionality of code reusability and backtracking.

## Example

Factorial of a number   
The factorial of a number n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.    
Mathematically: 
\(n! = n × (n - 1) × (n - 2) × ... × 2 × 1 \)
